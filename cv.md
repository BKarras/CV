Developed and implemented a sophisticated surveillance system that overcame technological limitations of some participating hospitals by installing local servers that applied de-identification and geo-coding algorithms.  By setting up these servers, the hospitals were able to securely transmit case reports to the health district which provided the health officers with ability to see in near-real-time what types of illnesses were affecting the citizens in the community
